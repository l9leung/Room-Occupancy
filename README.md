## Room-Occupancy
Predict whether an office room is occupied or vacant using using readings of the room's light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 measurements. The performance of Support Vector Machine, Deep Neural Network, Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest, and Linear Discriminant Analysis models were evaluated. Trained models were able to obtain accuracies of 95-99% on a hold-out set. A longer summary can be found [here](https://github.com/l9leung/Room-Occupancy/blob/main/report/report.pdf).
